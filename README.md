# Dungeon-game-with-unity
The project used unity to create a simple 2d dungeon game

For the files with "-Enemy" suffix, they are composed to implement a simple edition of Dungeon game, focusing on player and enemy. It contains a player (with a movable sword), automatically generated enemy (already set number in the code), and gateway (be attacked to open, not open until the last enemy). All the action can be seen in a single background. In the Sprites file of the Assets file, there are many image materials can be used for game designing.
